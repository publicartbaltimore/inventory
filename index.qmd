## About

The Baltimore Public Art Inventory is a resource with information on over 1,000 murals, sculptures, mosaics, monuments, and other public artworks in and around Baltimore City, Maryland.

This data was created by Eli Pousson and C. Ryan Patterson based on a wide range of sources documenting Baltimore monuments and murals. Additional contributions came from staff and volunteers at Baltimore City Commission on Historical and Architectural Preservation, Baltimore Heritage, the Baltimore Office of Promotion and the Arts, and local artists and residents.
